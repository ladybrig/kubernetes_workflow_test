        <div class="about-world">I made this world on January of 2021 and I've been playing for about 11 months, it's a hard mode survival world with no cheats, so at the beginning there are numerous deaths. This is also the second version of this seed as I attempted hardcore mode with this seed and died on day 79 or so to a creeper in a temple, I was mad but I liked the seed to I copied it and made a new world to be my main world that I wouldn't have to worry about losing. I have 2 other beginnings of areas in a jungle and a plains near a swamp and frozen ocean each with their own purpose, but in the future I have dozens of Ideas for now areas, buildings, farms, and just little additions that I think would look on my world. </div>
