This is my main nether portal, i wanted to design it as if the nether was creeping out of the portal and into the overworld, so I added tentacle like bits made of netherrack and a huge hand coming out the top, if you look through the portal I've also made a mini nether scene, so it's like you're actually looking through the portal.
