This is a birds-eye-view of my farm land, as you can see I have different areas for different crops. The main, consumption crops take up most of the land, each species has 3 rows, consisting of carrots, potatoes, wheat, beetroot, pumpkins, and melons. beside the barn are the other kinds of crops that are inedible, like nether wart, cactus, sugar cane, and chorus fruit (it's an exception because it's weird, and grows like a tree). Finally is the barn, it is currently unfinished but it is meant to store crops and also holds villagers who will trade me the crops I grow. Once I am done with my automation, however, I plan on getting rid of this area as it's very close to my main base and the automation will make this farm mostly obsolete.
