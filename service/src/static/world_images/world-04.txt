These are three of my auto farms: a sugar cane farm, a mushroom farm, and a kelp farm. Now these aren't the final spots for these as I plan on moving each of them and making them look nicer, but for now they get the job done. I have a few other farm as well including a spider, creeper, cactus, and gold/piglin trade/xp farm in the nether.
