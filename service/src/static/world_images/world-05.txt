Here you can see some flattened out, yet unused lad I have. I am showcasing my bridges here, as well as my design for a minecraft airport, where there are 4 levels aside from ground level, each with a purpose. The first level is where minecart tracks that lead to other areas are placed, that way you can travel to my different areas if you run out of rockets or your elytra breaks, at the moment I have only 1 track hooked up as shown. I'm still designing the next 2 levels, but I plan on making a storage system and a spawn platfrom for the 2nd and 3rd levels. The final, top level is the take off platform, where signs are places with coordinates to my other farther areas not connected to minecart tracks (cause they are too far)
