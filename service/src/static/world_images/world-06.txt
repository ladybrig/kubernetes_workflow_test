This is an over head view of my main area, I plan on moving or getting rid of a lot of these buildings, but I want to finish my auto farms and do a few other set up things first. you can see a bunch of rows in the bottom right corner, that is where I an preparing the staff (villagers) for my latest project: a mall. I'm "barganing" with the villagers using a system where I breed villagers, bring them to the infection line, give them professions, infect them and cure them until their prices are the minimum or they've been cured 5 times, and then I hold them in a row (with glass above to protect from lightning) for until I finish construction on the mall itself. I have a lot of work to do, luckily I'm almost done with the villagers.
