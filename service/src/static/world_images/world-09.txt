this is a view of the area above my main ender portal. As you can see I've done a bit of work to clear out the place, but am not quite finished. I actually did all of that work a while ago, but had to stop because I wasn't getting much progress done and wanted to work on more important matters, as at the time I hadn't even built my house, the airport, or even gotten an elytra yet. However I have big plans for this area.
